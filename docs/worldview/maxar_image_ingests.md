This is a list of efforts made to ingest WV images from Maxar in reverse chronological order.

## 2020-02 Jobos Bay NERR
FMK performed requests via the Maxar data portal assisted by Sebastian; Tylar and Digna were also on the call.
A bounding box was manually drawn around JBNERR.
Images with good coverage and low cloud cover were manually selected and sent to our servers via FTP.
38 `.zip` files in total were recieved on the server and successfully unzipped.
Each `.zip` appears to contain the multispectral and panspectral (m1bs and p1bs) files, .xml metadata, and several shapefiles as currently described in [./worldview/maxar_zip_files.md](https://github.com/USF-IMARS/data-docs/blob/master/docs/worldview/maxar_zip_files.md).

:warning: I don't recall if we used the "archive" or the (other?) catalog for this.
