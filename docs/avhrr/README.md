AVHRR data was collected via direct broadcast using the L-band satellite dish under the care of Doug Myhre.
The data collection became worse over time and in late 2019 collection was halted.

Raw L0 files can be found in `/srv/imars-objects/fullpass/hdf_avhrr_usf_sst/`
Until 2017 the L0 files were processed by a perl-based orchestration system running on modis, cylops, and dods into png images.
The resulting full-pass png images can be found in `/srv/imars-objects/fullpass`.
